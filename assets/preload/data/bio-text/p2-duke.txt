His eyes now glow a bright neon green, gains a large third eye on his chest, 
green spiked knuckles on his gloves and broken metal restraints, 
and the collar of his shoes now green. 
He also has black ooze splattered around his fists and pupils which cover his green pupils. 
Lastly his dreadlocks also glow the same color.
