Duke is an extraterrestrial life-form made of raw Void Essence built up over time from space decay and living beings.
His path to Earth was set because of said decay being put onto a dying star, that became a shooting asteroid nearby SEGA of Japan offices. 
No damage were done at the time.
A SEGA of Japan employee (currently unnamed), was the first to arrive to the fallen asteroid, and from there the influence of Duke took over his every being. 
He was the first victim of unforeseeable power and raw terror. 
This void essence decays the flesh in a way where once Duke finds his permanent place, the body is left but a weak husk.
It took time to find a place, but a Work in Progress copy of Knuckles' Chaotix: THE FINAL FRONTIER was Duke's choice, 
he felt with his current abilities, he could siphon the world's power through humans that interacted with him. 
The media present would work well, and his rise to take over will suffice.
His overtaking of the game landed on him on Knuckles, the host of this case. 
The melded look left him a mess when taking over him, but his body was able to keep himself patched up whilst in the body.

Duke has claimed his first throne, with many more to collect, but never too many.

Duke's current owner and was created by HarbingerBeats.
Former owner - PUMPKINMANJACK.
